Description:

The game is about taking care of a pet as it ages. The pet needs to be fed to maintain its energy level.
You also need to play with your pet by moving it to maintain its happiness level. Not feeding your pet or
playing with it will cause its energy level and happiness level to decrease as age increases. The pet can
be fed using booster pack button 1. You can also use launchpad button 1 and 2 to move your pet left
and right respectively. If the pet reaches zero energy level and zero happiness level the game ends and
the pet leaves. Be careful moving your pet because every two steps energy level decreases also with
happiness increasing. So, you must feed the pet while playing with it.
The game is implemented using an interrupt-driven code. This means that the processor will sleep if
there is no interrupt caused. We use hardware timer32 and buttons to flag an interrupt and make the
processor come back from sleep state. Whenever the processor is in sleep state launchpad green LED
will be on. It turns off only when the processor leaves sleep state and must do something which is a very
short period. This architecture is used because it is more efficient that polling architecture
