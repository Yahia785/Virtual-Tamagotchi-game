Description:

This game involves caring for a virtual pet as it ages, requiring regular feeding to maintain its energy level and playtime to sustain its happiness. 
Neglecting to feed or play with the pet will cause its energy and happiness levels to decrease as it grows older. The game allows the player to feed 
the pet using booster pack button 1 and move it using launchpad buttons 1 and 2 to the left and right, respectively.

If the pet's energy and happiness levels reach zero, it will leave the game and the game will end. It's important to be cautious when moving the pet 
since every two steps will cause a decrease in energy level, while increasing happiness. Hence, it's necessary to feed the pet while playing with it.

This game is implemented using an interrupt-driven code, which allows the processor to sleep when there are no interrupts present. Hardware timer32 
and buttons are utilized to trigger an interrupt and awaken the processor from sleep mode. The launchpad green LED will be on while the processor is 
in sleep mode and will turn off only when the processor returns to an active state. This architecture is chosen due to its higher efficiency than 
polling architecture.
